## Planing

First of all, I draw the site sessions in the [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com), keeping in mind the simplicity and also trying to give a good user experience to the final clients.

*Booking form result that displays a message saying to the user that the request has been added to the queue*

## Framework

The selected front end framework to this project is [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), combining to graphic framework [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/), cause of my previous familiarity and being simple to work enabling the focus on functionality.

All the requests are made using the native fetch browser api.
